# REST Web Services API For Clients

## This is the technical API documentation (focusing on client devs) for the REST Module. For general REST web service information and user documentation, see the module page.


## Resources

Every available object in the web services (ws) module is written up as a resource. The resource class defines the properties that are exposed and the setters that are available. The class also defines the representations and what goes in them (ref vs default vs full, see below for more on representations).

See documentation about resources and their URIs here: [REST Web Service Resources in OpenMRS 1.9](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/REST+Web+Service+Resources+in+OpenMRS+1.9)

You can also see some generated URI documentation on the "Help" page that the module puts into its Administration page section.

There is a uri that lists off the currently available resources in the installation (including module-provided resources):
